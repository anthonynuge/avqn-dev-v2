The client wanted a standalone app where they could input images of fruits and have the model classify what type it is with confidence reports. Each image is vectorized into numerical data and a convulational neural net was then applied to learn patterns and make predictions. Although Fruit Vision was made to classify fruit the model can be trained to classify any image if loaded with enough training data."
